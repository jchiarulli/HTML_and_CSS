# Layout and Position
* Position property can have 1 of 5 values
  * Static - default value for HTML elements, so no special properties, keeps the element in normal document flow
  * Relative - shift the element around the opage relative to its original position
  * Fixed - positions an element reklative to the viewport (part of the browser we see the webpage on), so if we scroll we'll still see the element
  * Absolute - position an element relative to its closet parent that has also been given a position that isn't static
  * Sticky - a mixture of static and fixed (static initially then becomes fixed when you scroll to a certain part of the webpage)
